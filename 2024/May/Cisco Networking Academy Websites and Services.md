Terms and Conditions for Use of Cisco Networking Academy Websites and Services

# Background.

<br> </br> The sites NetAcad.com and SkillsForAll.com are websites (“Websites”) within the Cisco Networking Academy Program (“Program”). Cisco operates and provides access to a range of Program related websites and microsites accessible to users (including students, nonstudents and alumni) who have a Cisco Username and Passwords. Websites contain content relevant to the Program and are also designed to enable social networking and collaboration ("Services") among users. The Services enable a user to create personal profiles (each, a "Profile") that can be searched and viewed by other users. The Services also support discussion forums, chat, electronic messaging, survey tools, blogs, wikis or other collaborative tools that Cisco elects to make available in its discretion. Cisco may modify, enhance, restrict or terminate Websites and Services in its discretion at any time and without notice.

The Program operates in accordance with global privacy laws, including laws that impact children's privacy. Registration or use of the Program is not intended for children. For the purposes of the Program, we consider an individual to be a child if the applicable law limits the processing of an individual's personal data because the individual is under a certain age (for example, individuals under 13 years of age are children in the US). If we discover that we have processed a child's personal data or that you have created an account that violates applicable privacy laws or this Agreement, we will terminate your account and promptly delete your personal data. The foregoing restrictions do not apply if an Academy authorized by Cisco to use our teaching materials and resources, has created an account for the individual in the Program. In such cases, the Academy is responsible for obtaining the appropriate consent(s) from the parent or guardian for collection, use and/or disclosure of the personal data in accordance with the applicable privacy laws.

Further, you may only enter into this Agreement if you are capable of forming a binding contract with Cisco, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable laws.
This Agreement; amending this Agreement.This Agreement is made up of the Terms and Conditions set out below, which are specific to the Program Websites and Services, and the general Cisco Terms and Conditions located here:http://www.cisco.com/web/siteassets/legal/terms_condition.html.. If there is a conflict between the two, then the Terms and Conditions set out below take precedence, solely to the extent of that inconsistency. This Agreement covers all of your visits to the Websites and any use of the Services. If you stop visiting the Websites or stop using the Services, this Agreement remains in effect with respect to your previous visits to the Websites and use of the Services.

# Amendments/Other Terms. <br> 

Cisco may change or supplement the terms of this Agreement from time to time at its sole discretion. Cisco will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice to you of any material changes to the Agreement (e.g., by posting on the Websites). Within five (5) business days of posting changes to the Agreement, the changes will be binding upon you. If you do not agree with the changes, you should discontinue using the Websites or any Services. If you continue using the Websites or Services after such five- business-day period, you will have accepted the changes to the terms of this Agreement. In order to participate in certain Services, you may be notified that you are required to download software and/or agree to additional terms and conditions. Unless expressly set forth in such additional terms and conditions, those additional terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement.
